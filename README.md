## Motivation

> Sharing is learning!

I started this blog as a way to document and share the things I have learned and found useful in my journey.

Writing and noting things down is a great way for me to solidify my understanding of new concepts and technologies,
and I hope that my blog can be a helpful resource for you.

I would be highly appreciated if you could leave your comments and thoughts on what I have written 🍻

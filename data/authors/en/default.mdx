I am Tran Thanh Tung. I graduated from the VNU University of Science.
Currently, I am working in the field of Optimization, combining programming tools
to solve real-world problems. This blog serves as a personal notebook where I record
my ideas and share my knowledge and experiences.

> Sharing is learning!

I hope you find something interesting here or at least know that it exists!
Happy reading!<Twemoji className="mx-2" emoji="clinking-beer-mugs"/>

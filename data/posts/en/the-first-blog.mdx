Planned since early 2022 with the goal of sharing my ideas and stories,
this blog was delayed due to my study and research at the university.
It was not until mid-2024 that I finally started building this website.

Now that it's finished, I'm excited to share engaging articles with you.
Stay tuned for upcoming posts! I hope you find something valuable and that
so happy if it benefits you. Thank you for reading, and best wishes to you!

*Thank you [quanhoang-pm](https://quanhoang-pm.github.io/), your blog has inspired me to
create my own blog. Thank you [timlrx](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog)
and [leohuynh](https://www.leohuynh.dev/) for being invaluable resources in the development
of this website.*

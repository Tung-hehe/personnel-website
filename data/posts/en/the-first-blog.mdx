I've been wanting to start a blog since early 2022 to share my thoughts and experiences,
but life (and school!) got in the way. Finally, in mid-2024, I was able to make it happen.

I'm pumped to share some awesome content with you! So stay tuned for new posts.
I hope you find something cool here. Thanks for reading, and good luck with everything!

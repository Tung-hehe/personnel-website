## 1. Binary variables

This method is used when we can precisely determine the possible values of a variable.
CFor instance, given an integer variable $x \in \mathbb{Z}$ with the condition $0 \leq x \leq 9$,
we can decompose the variable $x$ into 9 binary variables $x_i$ ($0 \leq i \leq 9$) to satisfy
```math
x_i = \begin{cases}
  1 & \text{ if } x\text{ is equal to } i \\
  0 & \text{ otherwise }
\end{cases}
```
Why do we need to decompose a variable into multiple variables? What is the benefit?
The answer is, suppose we have not only one variable $x$ as above but also another
variable $y \in \mathbb{Z}$ with the condition $0 \leq y \leq 9$. Then, it would be
very difficult to linearize the condition $x \neq y$ if we use these two variables.
On the other hand, if we decompose both $x$ and $y$ tinto binary variables, this condition
can be easily modeled as follows:  $x_i + y_i \leq 1, \forall 0 \leq i \leq 9$.

## 2. Modeling nonlinear constraints geometrically

This method is applicable when we can find a convex hull containing only points that
satisfy the desired constraint. For instance, to linearize the condition
$x = y \Leftrightarrow z = 1$ where $x, y, z$ are binary variables. We observe that the
feasible points are $(1, 1, 1), (0, 0, 1), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0)$. Geometrically representing
these points in three-dimensional space, we obtain the tetrahedron $ABCD$ shown below

![modeling-tips-tricks](/posts/ModelingTipsTricks.png)

The points within the tetrahedron $ABCD$ are precisely those that satisfy the given condition.
The equations defining this tetrahedron are the exact constraints needed to linearize the
original condition, specifically, the following conditions
```math
\begin{cases}
  x + y - z \geq 1 \\
  y + z - x \geq 1 \\
  z + x - y \geq 1 \\
  x + y = z \geq 1 \\
\end{cases}
```

**A few notes:**
- Use this method when we can determine all points satisfy original contraint
- There must exist a convex set that contains all and only the points satisfying the contraint
- The above convex set should be easily representable by other linear constraints
- From this point forward, I will use the term **geometric method** to describe this technique.
(This name is entirely my own creation, and I haven't consulted any references. It might not be
the correct terminology. If you know the proper term for this method, please let me know so I can correct it.)

## 3. Modeling nonlinear “$A$ or $B$” constraints

The typical form of these constraints is:
```math
\left[
\begin{array}{ll}
    f(x) & \geq A \\
    g(x) & \geq B
\end{array}
\right .
```

A common approach to linearize this type of constraint is to introduce an additional binary
variable that corresponds to the two cases of the original constraint and then try to reformulate
the original condition so that they are not contradictory. For example, consider linearizing the
following constraint with  $x, y \geq 0$

```math
\begin{cases}
  \left[
  \begin{array}{ll}
      2x + y \geq 5 \\
      x + 2y \geq 5
  \end{array}
  \right .\\
  x, y \geq 0
\end{cases}

```
Create binary variable $y$ satisfy

```math
z = \begin{cases}
  1 & \text{nếu } 2x + y \geq 5 \\
  0 & \text{nếu } x + 2y \geq 5 \\
\end{cases}
```

Then the original condition can be reformulated as follows
```math
\begin{cases}
  2x + y \geq Az \\
  x + 2y \geq A - A(1-z)\\
  x, y \geq 0
\end{cases}
```

***Note***: *This method is quite difficult to apply and requires case-by-case analysis to find
an appropriate linearization.*

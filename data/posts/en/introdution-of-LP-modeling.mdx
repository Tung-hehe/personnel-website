Linear programming is a technique to find the optimal solution in a mathematical model with
a linear objective function and linear constraints. A linear programming model has the following form
```math
\begin{aligned}
  \text{min} \quad & c^Tx && \\
  \text{s.t} \quad & Ax & \leq & \quad b \\
      & x & \geq & \quad 0 \\
\end{aligned}
```
Where $b$ and $c$ are constant column vectors, $A$ is a constant matrix,
and $x$ is a column vector representing the variables.

There are many efficient LP solvers available today, such as
[Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/), [SCIP](https://www.scipopt.org/),
and [COIN-OR](https://www.coin-or.org/). Therefore, if we can model
a problem as an LP, it can be considered solved. However, modeling a problem
is not always easy due to the following reasons.

- It is not straightforward to model all the conditions of a problem in a linear form.
- There are multiple ways to model a problem, but not all models are equally efficient.
A model, even if it accurately represents the problem, can be too large or have loose constraints,
leading to significant computational time.
- Sometimes, multiple models need to be constructed to solve a single problem. Building
each model and ensuring effective interactions between them is also a challenge.

In my work, linear programming is used extensively, and I have often witnessed breakthroughs
stemming from innovative modeling techniques. Therefore, I believe that modeling skills
are crucial and not easily mastered.

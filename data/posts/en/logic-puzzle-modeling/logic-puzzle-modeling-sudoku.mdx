## 1. Introduction

Sudoku, originally called Number Place l is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle.
In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a $9×9$ grid with digits so that each column, each row,
and each of the nine $3×3$ subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions")
contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which
for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

## 2. Modeling the puzzle
Some symbols used in this problem
- $n$ is a perfect square representing the size of the grid.
- $F$ is the set of pairs $(i, j)$ representing the coordinates of the pre-filled cells in the grid.
- $$V_{ij}$$ is the number filled in the cell $(i, j) \in F$
- $B_b$ is the set of cells $(i, j)$ in the $b$-th block($0 \leq b < n$).

### 2.1. Decision variables
For each cell $(i, j)$ in the grid and a number $k$, we define a variable $x(i,j,k)$ such that
```math
x(i, j, k) = \begin{cases}
  1 & \text{ nếu ô } (i, j)\text{ được điền giá trị } {k} \\
  0 & \text{ ngược lại }
\end{cases}
```

### 2.2. Constraints

- Each cell contains only one number.
```math
\sum\limits_{k = 1}^{n}{x(i, j, k)} \leq 1, \\ \forall 0 \leq i, j < n
```

- Each row contains all numbers from 1 to $n$
```math
\sum\limits_{j = 0}^{n - 1}{x(i, j, k)} = 1, \\ \forall 0 \leq i  < n, 1 \leq k  \leq n
```

- Each column contains all numbers from 1 to $n$
```math
\sum\limits_{i = 0}^{n - 1}{x(i, j, k)} = 1, \\ \forall 0 \leq j < n, 1 \leq k  \leq n
```

- Each block contains all numbers from 1 to $n$
```math
\sum\limits_{(i, j) \in B_b}{x(i, j, k)} = 1, \\ \forall 0 \leq b < n, 1 \leq k  \leq n
```

- Pre-filled cells
```math
x(i, j, V_{ij}) = 1, \\ \forall (i, j) \in F
```

### 2.3. Objective function

This problem does not have an objective function, as we are not aiming to minimize
or maximize any value. Our goal is simply to find a feasible solution. Technically,
when programming, we can set the objective function to a constant (I often choose 0)

## 3. Conclusion

Sudoku is one of the fundamental exercises for mastering modeling skills. When I
first started learning modeling, I was very impressed by the idea of using a
three-dimensional binary variable for this problem. All the remaining constraints
of the problem were modeled very easily with this variable assignment. This is also
a common technique used in modeling, and we will encounter these binary variables
again in future articles of this series.

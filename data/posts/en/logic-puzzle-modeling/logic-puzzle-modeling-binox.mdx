## 1. Introduction
Binox is a logic puzzle described as follows: given a grid of squares with some cells already filled with $X$ or $O$.
Player needs to complete the grid by filling in the empty cells with $X$ or $O$, satisfying the following conditions:
- The grid is completely covered by $X$ and $O$
- In each row/column, there is no sequence of more than 2 consecutive cells filled with the same symbol
- In each row/column, the number of $X$ is equal to the number of $O$
- Each row/column is unique (No two rows are the same, and no two columns are the same)

Below is an example of a 6×6 Binox puzzle and its solution.

## 2. Modeling the puzzle
- $n_R$ is the number of rows in the grid ($n_R$ is an even number)
- $n_C$ is the number of columns in the grid ($n_C$ is an even number)
- $F_X$ is the set of all cells $(i, j)$ already filled with $X$
- $F_O$ is the set of all cells $(i, j)$ already filled with $O$

### 2.1. Decision variables
For each cell $(i, j)$ in the grid, we define a variable $x(i, j)$ such that
```math
x(i, j) = \begin{cases}
  1 & \text{if cell } (i, j) \text{ filled with X } \\
  0 & \text{if cell } (i, j) \text{ filled with O }
\end{cases}
```

### 2.2. Constraints

- Cells already filled
```math
\begin{cases}
    x(i, j) = 1, \forall (i, j) \in F_X\\
    x(i, j) = 0, \forall (i, j) \in F_O
\end{cases}
```

- In each row, there is no sequence of more than 2 consecutive cells filled with the same symbol
```math
\begin{cases}
    x(i, j) + x(i, j + 1) + x(i, j + 2) \leq 2 \\
    x(i, j) + x(i, j + 1) + x(i, j + 2) \geq 1
\end{cases}
\\ \forall 0 \leq i < n_R, 0 \leq j < n_C - 2
```

- In each column, there is no sequence of more than 2 consecutive cells filled with the same symbol
```math
\begin{cases}
    x(i, j) + x(i + 1, j) + x(i + 2, j) \leq 2 \\
    x(i, j) + x(i + 1, j) + x(i + 2, j) \geq 1
\end{cases}
\\ \forall 0 \leq i < n_R - 2, 0 \leq j < n_C
```

- In each row, the number of $X$ is equal to the number of $O$
```math
\sum\limits_{j = 0}^{n_C - 1}{x(i, j)} = {n_C \over 2}, \\ \forall 0 \leq i < n_R
```

- In each column, the number of $X$ is equal to the number of $O$
```math
\sum\limits_{i = 0}^{n_R - 1}{x(i, j)} = {n_R \over 2}, \\ \forall 0 \leq j < n_C
```


- Each row is unique. To linearize this constraint, we can rephrase it as follows:
for any two rows $i$ and $j$, there exists at least one position $k$ such that $x(i, k) \ne x(j, k)$.

  For any two distinct rows $i \ne j$, and for each column k, we define an intermediate variable y(i, j, k) such that
  ```math
  y(i, j, k) = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if } x(i, k) = x(j, k) \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  ```
  Using [geometric method](/en/blog/modeling-tips-trick#2-modeling-nonlinear-constraints-geometrically)
  we can represent the variables $y$ through the variables $x$ by the following constraints:
  ```math
  \begin{cases}
    y(i, j, k) + x(i, k) + x(j, k) \geq 1 \\
    y(i, j, k) + x(i, k) \leq x(j, k) + 1 \\
    y(i, j, k) + x(j, k) \leq x(i, k) + 1 \\
    x(i, k) + x(j, k) \leq y(i, j, k) + 1
  \end{cases} \\ \forall 0 \leq i, j < n_R, i \ne j, 0 \leq k < n_C
  ```
  We linearize the original constraint using the variables $y$ as follows
  ```math
  \sum\limits_{k = 0}^{n_C - 1}{y(i, j, k)} \leq n_C - 1, \\ \forall 0 \leq i, j < n_R, i \ne j
  ```

- Each column is unique. Similarly to the above condition, for any two distinct columns $i$ and $j$,
and for each row $k$, we construct an intermediate variable $z(i, j, k)$ such that
  ```math
  z(i, j, k) = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if } x(k, i) = x(k, j) \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  ```
  Represent the variables $z$ through the variables $x$ by the following constraints:
  ```math
  \begin{cases}
    z(i, j, k) + x(k, i) + x(k, j) \geq 1 \\
    z(i, j, k) + x(k, i) \leq x(k, j) + 1 \\
    z(i, j, k) + x(k, j) \leq x(k, i) + 1 \\
    x(k, i) + x(k, j) \leq z(i, j, k) + 1
  \end{cases}
  \\ \forall 0 \leq k < n_R, 0 \leq i, j < n_C, i \ne j
  ```
  Linearize the original constraint as follows
  ```math
  \sum\limits_{k = 0}^{n_R - 1}{z(i, j, k)} \leq n_R - 1, \\ \forall 0 \leq i, j < n_C, i \ne j
  ```

### 2.3. Objective function
This problem does not have an objective function, as we are not aiming to minimize
or maximize any value. Our goal is simply to find a feasible solution. Technically,
when programming, we can set the objective function to a constant (I often choose 0)

## 3. Conclusion

The highlight of this puzzle is the unique row/column constraint. In reality,
such constraints are often very difficult to model efficiently. Imagine if we
had thousands of rows or columns; the number of constraints would be enormous.
In such cases, we must find alternative ways to solve the problem effectively

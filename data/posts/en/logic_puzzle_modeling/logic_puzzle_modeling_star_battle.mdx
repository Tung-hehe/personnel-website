## 1. Introduction
Star Battle is a logic puzzle defined as follows: given an $m√ón$ grid divided into regions,
players must fill the grid with stars that satisfy the following requirements:
- Each row, column, and region contains a specified number of stars.
- No two stars can be adjacent (in any direction).

Below is an example of a 10x10 Star Battle puzzle, with 2 stars in each row, column, and region

## 2. Modeling the puzzle
Some symbols used in this problem
- $n_R$ is the number of rows in the grid
- $n_C$ is the number of columnss in the grid
- $n$ is the number of stars to be placed in each row, column, and region
- $S$ is the set of regions
- $C_s$ is the set of cells $(i, j)$ belonging to region $s \in S$
- $$N_{ij}$$ is the set of neighboring cells of cell $(i, j)$ (including diagonals)
- $$f_{ij}$$ is the number of neighboring cells of cell $(i, j)$ (including diagonals)

### 2.1. Decision variables
For each cell $(i, j)$ in the grid, we define a variable $x(i,j)$ such that
```math
x(i, j) = \begin{cases}
    1 & \text{if cell } (i, j) \text{ contain a star } \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
```

### 2.2. Constraints

- Each row contains exactly $n$ stars
```math
\sum\limits_{j = 0}^{n_C - 1}{x(i, j)} = n, \\ \forall 0 \leq i < n_R
```

- Each column contains exactly $n$ stars
```math
\sum\limits_{i = 0}^{n_R - 1}{x(i, j)} = n, \\ \forall 0 \leq j < n_C
```

- Each region contains exactly $n$ stars
```math
\sum\limits_{\forall (i, j) \in C_s}{x(i, j)} = n, \\ \forall s \in S
```

- MNo two stars can be adjacent (in any direction).

  This condition can be rephrased as follows:
  if cell $(i,j)$ is filled with a star, then all cells adjacent
  to cell $(i,j)$ cannot be filled with a star.

  ```math
    x(i, j) = 1 \Rightarrow \sum\limits_{\forall (p, q) \in N_{ij}}{x(p, q)} = 0, \\ \forall 0 \leq i < n_R, 0 \leq j < n_C
  ```

  Linearizing the above condition using [geometric method](/en/blog/modeling-tips-trick#2-modeling-nonlinear-constraints-geometrically),
  we obtain the following constraint, which is the one used in the model.

```math
  f_{ij} \cdot x(i, j) + \sum\limits_{\forall (p, q) \in N_{ij}}{x(p, q)} \leq f_{ij}, \\ \forall 0 \leq i < n_R, 0 \leq j < n_C
```

### 2.3. Objective function
This problem does not have an objective function, as we are not aiming to minimize
or maximize any value. Our goal is simply to find a feasible solution. Technically,
when programming, we can set the objective function to a constant (I often choose 0)
